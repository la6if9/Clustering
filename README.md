# Clustering

## Wine data

The wine data include 13 features of three different wine cultivars in Italy.

1.load the data
2.Perform six k-means cluster analyses on the 13 (standardized) features
3.Display a confusion matrix of the three clusters of the k-means analysis with three centers

## Animals 

The data set Animals contains the brain and body weights for 28 species of land animals. This data lends itself very well for making a taxonomy. We will perform a series of hierarchical cluster analyses with varying options.

1.load the data
2.plot the dendograms of the hierarchical cluster analyses on the original animals data

3.standardizing the features & plotting the dendogram

4.display boxplots of the standardized features (we notice that 1st two features have an extremely skewed distribution)

5. applying a logarithmic transformation to the 1st two features of animals

6. Final Clustering
